<hr/>

## Introduction

This script was created to compare the dat file and hashes generated by the generate_dat_files and hashDB jobs of the carol data platform.

- **Simple to Start**

> Before running the script it must contain two files, data.json and data2.json.. each one contains the employee data generated from the hashDB and generate_dat_files jobs, so it is necessary to generate these two files and compare them with the script.

## Installation

Use the command to run script:

```bash
yarn install and node index.js
```
